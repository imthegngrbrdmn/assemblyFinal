# assemblyFinal
The code runs from the main function. Currently 
intended to be run as a visual studio solution.

## main.cpp
The main file runs all of the levels and lives as 
a central point to play the story parts.

## combat.cpp
The combat file runs all of the combat for encounters.

## level0.cpp, level1.cpp, level2.cpp, level3.cpp
These files run the level pieces to the user and 
contain the actual story and plot.

## inventory.cpp
This file contains all of the inventory functions and 
makes it easy to interact with the character's inventory.

## levelTemplate.h
This file contains the template for all 
of the levels and organises everything 
so that all of the files can be as simple 
and easy to read as possible.
